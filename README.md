# best-revit-door
WIll create the best door revit has ever seen.

I plan on creating a revit door family(ies) that will rock them all!

I plan on having:

- Inter-Changable door hardware
- Parametric Windows
- Paramatric Door Panels
- Toggle-able Door Threshold
- Displayable ADA door clearances
- Door Swing Angle
- and MORE!!! (that i can think of)

Note: Will probably have to make a second family in the future for double doors.
